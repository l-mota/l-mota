# Hi there, I'm Lucas Mota ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced Full Stack Developer with over 4 years of experience.

Throughout my career as a Full Stack Developer, I have helped my clients get their projects off the ground, promoting integration and scalability in modern applications while ensuring efficiency and functionality.

I have created institutional websites, landing pages for courses and products, and complete systems (both back-end and front-end) using various technologies, including: Node.js, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Express, Fastify, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Git, Tailwind CSS, Docker, and more.

I love creating dynamic and scalable web applications that provide a great user experience.
